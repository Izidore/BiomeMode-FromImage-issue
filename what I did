I really could use some help.

Please tell me what I am doing wrong.

I am trying to generate a world from a map image.

TC is installed as single player/forge.

I created a minecraft world named 'Terrain Test'; creative, cheats on, World Type:TerrainControl 

I attempted to use the /tc map command but get the Unknown command error.

I quit the game.

I created a small test png file using a paint program and named it map.png.

The image is 100 X 100 pixels with a '+' (about 50 X 50 pixels using lines 10 pixels thick) drawn in the plains green and the background is ocean blue.

I went to .minecraft/mods/TerrainControl/worlds/Terrain Test/WorldConfig.ini and made the following changes:

- BiomeMode:FromImage
- ImageMode:FillEmpty

I saved the file.

I then moved the map.png file to the .minecraft/mods/TerrainControl/worlds/Terrain Test folder.

I then went to .minecraft/saves/Terrain Test and deleted the region folder.

I started minecraft and joined my Terrain Test world.

The terrain regenerated but it just created massive ocean biom and did not generate the image.

I went to x: 0, z: 0 and flew all around but did not see anything that even remotely resemble the png image.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
